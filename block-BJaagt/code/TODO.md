Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

2. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output >>> this will also throw an error since username is defined not at global level.

```

3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output >> this will also throw an error since username is defined not at global level.

```

if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output >>> this will also throw an error since username is defined not at global level.

```

5. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output >>> username already defined 

```

 5 'First'
 6 'First'
 7 'First'
 8 'First'

}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // output  >>>  10, Second
```
